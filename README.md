# Eyewitness UI
User interface to allow admins to interact with their Eyewitness bot.

## Dependencies

#### Required
* Node.js (see the "engines" property in package.json for supported versions).
* Npm package manager.

#### Optional
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download) 17+ (for local testing)
* [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) (for local testing)
* MongoDB (if not using Docker for local testing)

## Local Development
